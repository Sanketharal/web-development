        Nature is the natural world, including all plants, animals, and other living things, as well as the physical features of the Earth, such as landforms, bodies of water, and the atmosphere. Nature is often contrasted with the human-made world, but the two are inextricably linked. Humans are part of nature, and we rely on it for our survival and well-being.</p>
